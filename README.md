# Property Analysis - Onboarding Project

## 📌 Introduction
The **Property Analysis Onboarding Project** focused on applying skills in **SQL, data querying, and Power BI reporting**. The project involved working with a **Data Warehouse, SQL queries, and Power BI visualizations** to analyze property-related insights.

## 📂 Project Overview
Key tasks in this project included:

- **Task A**: Counting the number of cities in each state.
- **Task B**: Identifying the number of unique postcodes and suburbs in each city.
- **Task C1**: Calculating the average Property Median Value by Suburb.
- **Task C2**: Calculating the average Property Median Value by Postcode.
- **Task C3**: Analyzing the Average Property Median Value by both Suburb and Postcode while filtering out records with missing values.
- **Power BI Report**: Creating data visualizations based on the SQL queries.

## 📊 Key Learnings
This project provided hands-on experience in:
- **Importing and structuring data** within a database.
- Developing **SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights from property data.
- Building **interactive Power BI reports** to visualize the results effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL Server** (SSMS / SSIS for data import and management)
- **SQL Queries** for data retrieval and analysis
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and reporting

## 📑 Project Workflow
### 🔹 Step 1: Data Preparation & Import
- A **Data Warehouse database** was created to store structured property data.
- The dataset was imported using **SQL Server Import Data Wizard and SSIS**.
- Primary keys were defined, and relationships between tables were established.

### 🔹 Step 2: Writing SQL Queries
- Queries were written to determine **city counts, unique postcodes, suburb distribution, and property median values**.
- SQL code was formatted following best practices for clarity and efficiency.

### 🔹 Step 3: Building a Power BI Report
- Power BI was connected to the SQL database.
- **Data transformation and cleansing** were performed using Power Query.
- **Interactive visualizations** were created, including:
  - Median Property Value by **City/Town, Suburb, and Postcode**.
  - Categorized property values into **different price ranges**.
  - Geographic mapping using **Latitude and Longitude**.
- **Interactive slicers** were added for better data exploration.

## 📸 Project Outcomes
 SQL queries and Power BI visualizations are included in the repository.
