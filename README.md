# Property Analysis - BI Developer/Data Analyst Onboarding Sprint

## 📌 Introduction
The **Property Analysis Onboarding Sprint** is designed to help data analysts and BI developers gain hands-on experience with SQL, data import, querying, and Power BI reporting. This project demonstrates essential skills required to work with a **Data Warehouse, SQL queries, and Power BI visualizations**.

## 📂 Project Structure
This repository contains the following tasks:

- **Task A**: Number of cities in each state.
- **Task B**: Number of unique postcodes and suburbs in each city.
- **Task C1**: Average Property Median Value by Suburb.
- **Task C2**: Average Property Median Value by Postcode.
- **Task C3**: Average Property Median Value by both Suburb and Postcode.
- **Task C4**: Filtering out records with no median value.
- **Power BI Report**: Data visualization based on the above queries.

## 📊 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
- Learn how to **import data** into a database and define table relationships.
- Develop **SQL queries** to analyze property data.
- Build **interactive Power BI reports** for better data insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL Server** (SSMS / SSIS for data import)
- **SQL Queries** for data retrieval and analysis
- **Power BI** for visualization and reporting

## 📑 Project Steps
### 🔹 Step 1: Data Import
- Download the raw dataset (Excel files).
- Create a **Data Warehouse database**.
- Import the dataset using **Import Data or SSIS**.
- Define **Primary Keys** for each table.

### 🔹 Step 2: Writing SQL Queries
- Write queries for **city count, unique postcodes, suburb counts, and average median property values**.
- Ensure proper SQL formatting and coding standards.

### 🔹 Step 3: Building a Power BI Report
- Connect Power BI to the database.
- Perform **data cleansing and transformation** using Power Query.
- Create **visualizations**:
  - Average Property Median Value by **City/Town, Suburb, Postcode**.
  - Categorized Median Value ranges **(0-750K, 750K-1.5M, 1.5M-2.5M, 2.5M+)**.
  - Geographic map visualization using **Latitude and Longitude**.
- Implement **slicers** for City/Town, Suburb, Postcode, and Property Median Value.

## 📸 Screenshots
All tasks and Power BI report screenshots are included in this repository.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/property-analysis.git
   ```
2. Load the SQL scripts into **SQL Server** and execute them.
3. Open **Power BI**, connect to the database, and load the dataset.
4. Analyze the **Power BI report** and explore different insights.

## 📝 SQL Coding Standards
- **Capitalize** SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`).
- Use **lowercase** for database objects (e.g., table names, column names).
- Break code into **multiple lines** for readability.
- Use **meaningful aliases** for tables.
- Apply **proper indentation**.
